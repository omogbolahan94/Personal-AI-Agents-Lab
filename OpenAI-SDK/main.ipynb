       "\n",
       "**1. LangChain**: A Python-based framework renowned for its modular design, LangChain enables developers to build complex, multi-step workflows by integrating prompts, models, memory, and external tools. It supports a wide range of large language models (LLMs) and offers extensive integrations, making it ideal for applications requiring intricate logic and diverse functionalities.

       "\n",
       "**2. AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the creation of autonomous, event-driven systems, particularly multi-agent systems. It allows for seamless communication and collaboration among multiple AI agents, enabling the development of sophisticated conversational AI agents capable of solving complex problems through coordinated efforts. ([radarmagazine.com](https://www.radarmagazine.com/top-5-ai-agent-frameworks-it-executives-should-be-watching-in-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. CrewAI**: CrewAI is a lightweight Python framework focused on building collaborative agent systems. It emphasizes the creation of teams of agents with defined roles and responsibilities, simplifying the orchestration of multi-agent systems and enhancing collaborative task execution. This framework is particularly useful for applications requiring coordinated efforts among specialized agents to achieve shared goals.

# accounts.py Python Module Design

The `accounts.py` module is a self-contained Python module that implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. Below is a detailed design of the module, outlining the classes and methods it contains.

## Classes and Methods

### Class: Account

The `Account` class is the main class representing a user's account in the system. It handles account creation, deposit and withdrawal of funds, transaction recording, portfolio valuation, and more.

#### Methods

- `__init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
  - Initializes a new account with a unique `user_id` and an `initial_deposit` amount.
  - Initializes account balance, portfolio, transaction list and initial deposit tracking.

- `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Adds `amount` to the balance of the account.
  - Raises a ValueError if the deposit amount is not positive.

- `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Subtracts `amount` from the account balance.
  - Raises an exception if `amount` is greater than the available balance.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`
  - Buys `quantity` of shares for the given `symbol`, deducting the cost from the balance.
  - Calls `get_share_price(symbol)` to get the current price per share.
  - Updates the portfolio with the purchased shares.
  - Records the transaction.
  - Raises an exception if insufficient funds to complete the purchase.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`
  - Sells `quantity` of shares for the given `symbol`, adding the proceeds to the balance.
  - Calls `get_share_price(symbol)` to get the current price per share.
  - Updates the portfolio by reducing the number of shares.
  - Records the transaction.
  - Raises an exception if there are not enough shares to sell.

- `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
  - Calculates and returns the total value of the shares in the portfolio based on the current share prices.

- `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
  - Calculates the net profit or loss based on the initial deposit and current account balance combined with portfolio value.

- `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
  - Returns a dictionary representing the user's current holdings with share symbols and respective quantities.

- `get_transactions(self) -> list`
  - Returns a list of all transactions made on this account.

## Example Usage

```python
def get_share_price(symbol):
    prices = {'AAPL': 150, 'TSLA': 700, 'GOOGL': 2800}
    return prices.get(symbol, 0)

account = Account(user_id="user123", initial_deposit=10000)
account.deposit_funds(5000)
account.buy_shares("AAPL", 10)
account.sell_shares("AAPL", 5)
portfolio_value = account.get_portfolio_value()
profit_loss = account.get_profit_or_loss()
holdings = account.get_holdings()
transactions = account.get_transactions()
```

This module is designed to provide a comprehensive simulation of a trading account, adhering to the business rules provided and ensuring users cannot perform invalid actions such as overdrawing funds or trading more shares than available.

This design outlines both the class structure and the method signatures, ensuring clarity for backend development, and following standards for ease of further testing and user interface integration.

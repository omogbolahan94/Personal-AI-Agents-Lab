# SoftwareEngineeringTeam Crew

Welcome to the SoftwareEngineeringTeam Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```

Now navigate in the software_engineering_team directory:
```{bash}
cd software_engineering_team 
```

### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/software_engineering_team/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/software_engineering_team/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/software_engineering_team/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/software_engineering_team/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```
This command initializes the software_engineering_team Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.


To run the gradient app created by the agentic workflow, run the command:
```{py}
cd output
uv add gradio
uv run app.py
```

**Note:**

One of the major challenges I faced while working on my recent project was dependency version mismatches.

The initial Gradio code generated by an LLM (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) was written for an older version of Gradio, while I had a newer version installed locally. This caused compatibility issues and runtime errors.

To fix it, I checked the latest Gradio documentation and updated the code to match the new API.
The main change was how Gradio references the callable functions — in my case, functions like deposit, withdraw, buy_shares, sell_shares, and others — which needed to be restructured to work correctly with the latest version.

After making those adjustments, the application ran perfectly.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The software_engineering_team Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
